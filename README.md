# React Native Authentication
> Creating a simple app that uses authentication with Firebase.

## Overview
> This is an app that uses authentication with Firebase. I created a simple login form that validates a user and throws errors if the user input invalid login information. You can also logout after logging in which send you back to the initial login form.
